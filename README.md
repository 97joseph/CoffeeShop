For various reasons, Ethiopia suffers from an image problem. Our image has become our karma and our destiny is predictable. A changed image would open the possibility for a new destiny. As Ethiopia is the birthplace of coffee, we believe it can play a huge role in developing a positive image of our country and people. Our company was born to ”change destiny by changing image”A website for a specialty coffee green beans supplier from Ethiopia in English and Chinese.

Ethiopia is the birthplace of coffee and our company aims to rebrand Ethiopia through its amazing coffee. Our tagline is “changing destiny by changing image”. Our company is called Source Coffee “the original”
